## Running Tests and Migrations
```bash
# Apply migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create migration files
python manage.py makemigrations

# Run Django test suite
python manage.py test
```

## Deployment
- Use Docker Compose for single-host deployments with Nginx + Gunicorn/Uvicorn + Celery + Redis + PostGIS.
- Set `DEBUG=False` and provide secure production values for `SECRET_KEY`, hosts, CORS, CSRF, and database credentials.
- Configure persistent volumes for media, static files, and PostgreSQL data.
- Route background processing through the Celery worker service.
- Recommended targets include AWS EC2/ECS, Railway, Render, or any container-compatible platform.
- Place a reverse proxy/load balancer in front of the application and terminate TLS at the edge.
